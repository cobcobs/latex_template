# Cobcobs' LaTeX Template

A personal template heavily based on the [Tufte-Handout Style](https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/)

## Usage
Copy `main.tex` to your working directory
```bash
cp main.tex [your_working_directory]
```

A `sample.tex` and `sample.pdf` are included; these were written by the Tufte-LaTeX developers.
